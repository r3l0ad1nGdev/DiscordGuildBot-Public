GuildBot" DiscordGuildBot-Public" 
DO NOT claim this as your own work, however you are free to use this for whatever purpose. If you decide to cite me as the creator, use my discord @r3l0ad1nG#6118

This bot acts as a way to manage and create questionairs that people can answer in their dms via reactions and based on a scoring system for each question, roles are assigned to them. The scores, reactions, questions etc. are all defined in a json (there is a sample json labeled SampleConfigCommandAttachment.json with a demo environmente you can run) that is passed as an argument or loaded via the []loadconfig command. There is a demo token in intilization.cs (its not a real bot, don't bother using it) where to put your own token. In order for the bot to launch, add the channel ID for which the first message to be sent in BotEnvironment.cs THIS IS MANDATORY otherwise the bot will not work. 

The Bot runs on the D-Sharp Plus library which can be found here:https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus
